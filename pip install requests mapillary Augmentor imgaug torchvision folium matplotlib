## Usage

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Run the data collection script to fetch street view images from Mapillary.
   - Ensure you have obtained an API key and configured the script with the correct API endpoint and parameters.
   - Specify the target region and bounding box for data collection.
   - The script will download images and store them in a structured directory along with a metadata file.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Organize the downloaded images into directories based on regions or cities.
   - Encode latitude and longitude using cyclical encoding.
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset.
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train the model using the prepared dataset.
   - Set training parameters such as batch size, epochs, and learning rate.
   - Monitor training progress and adjust parameters as needed.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model using the validation set.
   - Calculate the mean geodesic error to assess model performance.
   - Visualize predictions on a map to understand model accuracy.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Export the trained model in a deployable format.
   - Set up the deployment environment with necessary dependencies.
   - Develop a prediction script to input images and output geographical coordinates.
   - Test the deployment by running the prediction script on sample images.
